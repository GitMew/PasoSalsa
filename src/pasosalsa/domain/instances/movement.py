# TODO: All these starting positions are very inelegant to define.
#   - You don't want to copy "feet together" for both leader and follower.
#   - What if the follower starts turned 90Â°? Ideally you can define the follower's starting position on a coarse grid w.r.t. the leader.
#   - You can't really define the follower's absolute coordinates if you don't know where the leader will be.
#       - You really want something like "LeaderFeetTogether, FollowerInFront" but you can't define this in absolute terms obviously.
