# TODO
- Smart bendy arrows
- In-place rotating arrows
- For figures like enchufla, there should be a difference between a clockwise and a counterclockwise half-turn.
  - Similarly: we have turns that can be over 360Â°. The arrows should spiral then.
- For figures like crusado, there is an "alternate" base.
- Follower steps:
  - Have an easy way of defining the follower's starting position
  - Visualise leader+follower, only leader, only follower.
- Coarse-grained view (i.e. just leader-follower, not the feet)
